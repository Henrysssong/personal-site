# Intro

I am an undergraduate computer science student at UC Berkeley. I love entrepreneurship and 
technology and believe how the combination of the two will push humanity forward. I have recently co-founded [Got10IN](https://got10in.com), which aims to revolutionize and democratize college application consulting industry with LLM agents. Previously, I had multiple experiences in software engineering, venture capital and startups. If you have any projects. Whether it is commercial or academic, as long as it is leveraging the most cutting edge technology to solve a realistic problem, please contact me!
